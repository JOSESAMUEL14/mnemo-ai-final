> *"The AI That Never Forgets You"*

**Mnemo AI** is a complete Life Intelligence Platform that builds a permanent knowledge graph of your entire life journey — every struggle, every win, every dream — and fights for you **every single day**.

---

## 🎯 **Hackathon Track**

**Track 1: Best Use of Cognee Open Source**

- ✅ Uses **Cognee V1 Open Source** (self-hosted)
- ✅ Implements all **4 core Cognee APIs**: `remember`, `recall`, `improve`, `forget`
- ✅ Built with **₹0 budget** — completely free
- ✅ **Solo developer** — 7 days of focused building

## 🌟 The Problem

Every night, millions of people go to sleep feeling lost and forgotten.

Today's AI tools are **stateless** — they forget you the moment you close the tab. Your struggles disappear. Your goals vanish. Your growth is invisible. You start over from zero every single time.

There is no AI that truly *knows* you — your patterns, your fears, your progress, your story.

**This is the "Hangover Problem" — and Mnemo AI solves it.**

---

## 💡 The Solution

Mnemo AI uses **Cognee V1's revolutionary memory layer** to build a living knowledge graph of your life. It remembers everything you share — and gets smarter about you every single day.

- 🌙 **Tell Mnemo about your day** → get deeply personal motivation
- ☀️ **Wake up to DayStart Fuel** → based on your actual journey
- 🧠 **Ask anything about your life** → Mnemo knows your whole story
- 📈 **Watch your growth** → through your personal memory graph
- 🎯 **Lock in your goals** → Mnemo never lets you forget your dreams

## 🧠 How Cognee Powers Mnemo AI

Mnemo AI uses **all 4 core Cognee V1 APIs** meaningfully:

### 1. `cognee.remember()` — Save Life Memories

```python
# Daily journal entry
await cognee.remember(
    "JOURNAL 2026-07-01 MOOD:determined - Today I built something real.",
    dataset_name="main_dataset",
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)

# Lock in a goal
await cognee.remember(
    "GOAL: Win this hackathon and prove myself",
    dataset_name="main_dataset",
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)

# Time Capsule
await cognee.remember(
    "TIME CAPSULE 2026-08-01: Dear future me, today I started with nothing...",
    dataset_name="main_dataset",
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)
```

### 2. `cognee.recall()` — Query Life Memories

```python
# Get personal motivation
results = await cognee.recall(
    "Based on my journey, give me powerful motivation for tomorrow.",
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)

# Life Ask
results = await cognee.recall(
    "When was the last time I felt truly proud?",
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)

# Pattern detection
results = await cognee.recall(
    "Analyze my memories and describe my resilience and growth as percentages.",
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)
```

### 3. `cognee.improve()` — Bridge Session to Permanent Memory

```python
# Run at end of each day to make session memories permanent
await cognee.improve(
    dataset="main_dataset",
    session_ids=[SESSION_ID],
    build_global_context_index=True
)
```

### 4. `cognee.forget()` — Forget and Heal

```python
# Release a specific dataset
await cognee.forget(dataset="main_dataset")

# Complete fresh start
await cognee.forget(everything=True)
```

## 🎯 **Why This Project Stands Out**

1. **Solves the "Hangover Problem"** — AI that truly never forgets
2. **Uses ALL 4 Cognee APIs** — not just one or two
3. **Complete, polished application** — not a prototype
4. **45+ premium features** — all completely free
5. **₹0 budget** — built with free tools
6. **Solo developer** — 7 days of focused building
7. **PWA + Voice + Notifications** — modern web experience
